# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ :name => 'Chicago' }, { :name => 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(:name => 'Daley', :city => cities.first)
#[
#  {:name => "Mt. Pleasant School District"},
#  {:name => "San Francisco Unified"},
#  {:name => "Dickenson County"},
#  {:name => "Wm S. Hart School District"},
#  {:name => 'The Logan Hockings School District'} 
#].each do |attributes|
#  District.find_or_create_by_name(attributes)
